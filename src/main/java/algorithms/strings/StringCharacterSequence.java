/*

Given a string of characters, return a string where
all occurrences of 3 or more matching characters in a
row have been removed.

This removal is performed in a greedy fashion, moving
from left to right. Phrased differently, matching
characters are removed as soon as they are observed.

This is similar to the game candy crush, where
objects move down a 2-D board and are crushed when
3 or more matching objects are stacked.

Example:  "aaa" -> ""

Example: "abbb" -> "a"

Example: "abbbc" -> "ac"

Example: "BBAAAACCCBBBD" -> "D"

Example:  "abbbcccaadZddd" -> "dZ"
